The Workout Creator is a Python program designed to help users create personalized workout routines based on their preferences. It runs in the terminal, offering a convenient way to generate full-body workouts that include warm-up, main workout, and cool-down exercises.

## How to use

The Workout Creator is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Users can specify their desired workout duration and select a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard). Based on these inputs, the program generates a complete workout plan.

1. Start the Program: Run the program in your terminal to be greeted by the main menu.
2. Create a Workout: Choose the workout duration (between 10 and 60 minutes) and the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
   The program will generate exercises targeting different muscle groups.
3. Save and View Workouts: You can save generated workout and access them later.
4. Warm-Up and Cool-Down: Every workout includes fixed warm-up and cool-down to help prevent injury.
